# avocado

The dataset contains historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets. [source data](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices/home) is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

For more relevant data, please refer to [here](http://www.hassavocadoboard.com/retail/volume-and-price-data)


## Installation

You can install the released version of avocado from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("avocado")
```

## Example

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
